# Config Loader (CICP Plugin)

This CICP plugin allows you to dynamically change the configuration of the any other plugins by sending query to any domain with some specific headers.  

# How to use it

## Other plugins dependencies

This plugin depends on:
- [@dblk/autopilot](https://github.com/dblk/autopilot)
- [@dblk/recorder](https://github.com/dblk/recorder)

## Add it to CICP

Install it to your `plugins` folder, then do not forget to add it while launching the cli: `cicp -o autopilot,configLoader,recorder`.   
This plugin must be _after_ autopilot _and before_ recorder.

## Require this plugin from another

Simply add the following object in your `package.json`:

```json
"plugin": {
  "consumes": [
    "configLoader",
  ],
}
```

## Autopilot registered commands

This plugin register some command to allow to change dynamically its configuration through the following headers:

- X-DBLK-CICP-RECORD recordset
    - Launch a record 
- X-DBLK-CICP-RECORD-END recordset 
    - End the record (Save to disk)
- X-DBLK-CICP-REPLAY-FILE recordset  
    - Replay a recordset, fails if it does not found it
- X-DBLK-CICP-REPLAY-FILE-OR-RECORD recordset  
    - Replay a recordset, records if it does not found it
- X-DBLK-CICP-LOAD-ALL
    - Load every config folder in memory for fast use and concurrent test response
- X-DBLK-CICP-RECORD-SET
    - Specify the current recordset in which the query should look into

## Amend the config

From another plugin you can amend the config by calling the function `defaultPluginConfig`.

__Arguments__

* object:
  * plugin (String) - Name of the plugin
  * data (Any) - The default configuration for this plugin

This function is useful to set a global configuration for each requests.  
In addition to that, you can inside each request object, add a different value from general settings.

For example, with the [@dblk/recorder](https://github.com/dblk/recorder) plugin, you can specify a `speed` value to `original` to replay with the original delay.

# Additional Informations

This plugin will emit the event `NEW_SET` once it has finished to load a recordset and amend it with the default configuration.  
This module use `DEBUG` so feel free to add `DEBUG=cicp:configLoader` to see debug logs.
